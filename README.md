# ScenarioRiskQuantification

This repository contains the Python implementation of a scenario-based risk quantification approach which is described in detail in:

*In preparation*.

# Running the code

We considered 3 different scenario categories: leading vehicle decelerating (LVD), cut-in, and approaching slower vehicle (ASV).
The risk of each of these 3 scenario categories is separately estimated in a Python notebook:

- [leading_vehicle_decelerating.ipynb](leading_vehicle_decelerating.ipynb)
- [cut-in.ipynb](cut-in.ipynb)
- [approaching_slower_vehicle.ipynb](approaching_slower_vehicle.ipynb)
